I like to use `dotenv` but it's your choice the choose the best tool you can work with
environment text. I will show you how to set up and work with the `dotenv`

1. Add a .env file in the main folder.
2. Fill the .env with your credentials. Don't use the '' or "" inside the .env
   Example:
   `CONSUMER_KEY=xxxx CONSUMER_SECRET=xxxx ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxx ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=xxxx`
