It's required to add your env keys before running the server to proper function

### ðŸ’µ How to use it

I use `dotenv` but it's your choice to choose the best tool you can work with an
environment variables. 
Now, I will demonstrate how to set up and work with the `dotenv` package

1. Add a .env file in the main folder.
2. Fill the .env with your credentials. Don't use the '' or "" inside the .env
   Example:
   `CONSUMER_KEY=xxxx CONSUMER_SECRET=xxxx ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxx ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=xxxx`
3. Start the app and enjoy!
